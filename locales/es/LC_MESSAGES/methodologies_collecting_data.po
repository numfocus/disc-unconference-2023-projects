"Currently, contributor statistics exist in GitHub, but these are publicly"
" available on an individual project level only. This presents a challenge"
" to analysis spanning multiple projects. For example, one individual may "
"be a new contributor to one project, but a core maintainer of a second "
"project, and a regular contributor to a third project. Having "
"programmatic visibility into the entire span of many contributors’ "
"experience across projects can help project leads/maintainers better "
"navigate and nurture the relationships with their contributor base."

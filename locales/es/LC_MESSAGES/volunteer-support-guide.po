"Volunteering is a critical form of support for many organizations. There "
"are many benefits and opportunities available to volunteers  through the "
"nature of their work, yet volunteer burnout is too common of a "
"phenomenon. This comprehensive guide is meant to help  organizations "
"reduce volunteer burnout in two ways, by: recognizing the many barriers "
"to and stressors of volunteering providing actionable suggestions for "
"organizations to combat these stressors and support volunteers"

"*Volunteer* - someone who performs a service or work voluntarily, usually"
" unpaid  *Burnout* - emotional or physical exhaustion, usually as a "
"response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job "
"*Marginalized groups* - groups who historically have been underserved and"
" undervalued, largely due to identity demographics (e.g. people who are "
"BIPOC, women, gender minorities, etc.)"

"People get involved in volunteering for a number of reasons: as a form of"

"The open nature of volunteerism paradoxically can also reproduce societal"
" inequalities. Volunteer works cuts into leisure  time and inherently "
"demands stability, resources, energy and time from volunteers – therein "
"lies the source of many issues  related to burnout, as volunteering "
"becomes more unsustainable over time. Volunteer participation is "
"dependent on an  individual’s available leisure time (and fiscal "
"resources to compensate for that time). This dependency can be especially"
"  strenuous for volunteers from marginalized backgrounds, who are "
"historically underserved and may have limited resources,  leading many to"
" burnout and dropout over time."

"We hope this guide can help organizations be aware of and reduce these "
"barriers to participation for their volunteers.  Organizations have a "
"multitude of resources available to them, e.g. monetary funds, personnel,"
" institutional knowledge,  which can be leveraged to support volunteers. "
"This guide aims to provide clarity on how organizations can reduce "
"burnout  in their volunteers by providing recommendations and inspiration"
" for how organizations can best utilize the resources available to them."

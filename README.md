# DISC Unconference 2023 - Project outputs
A collection of outputs from the projects created at the DISC Unconference 2023.

## How to build and visualize these documents

This repository sets up a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/your-first-book.html). All content is markdown files stored in the `unconference` folder.

To add a new project page:

1. Add your markdown file to the `unconference` folder;
2. Add the name of your markdown file to the `_toc.yml` file, under the `chapters` heading.
3. Submit a pull request to this repo. **Make sure to add your collaborators as co-authors on the pull request.** Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/pt/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors) for guidance on how to do it.

### Building locally

To build the book locally, you need to have [JupyterBook installed](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/install.html). You can use either `pip` or `conda` to install this and other requirements for your book by running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
conda create -f environment.yml
conda activate projects
```

Then, run

```bash
sphinx-build unconference unconference/_build/html -b html
```

to build the book. You can then open the generated `unconference/_build/html/index.html` file in your browser to view the book. You can use `python -m webbrowser unconference/_build/html/index.html` to open the website directly on your default browser.

By default, the English version is generated. In order to build a different language
(provided translations are already available), set the `WEBSITE_LANGUAGE` env variable
to the language code you want to use, e.g. `es`.

### GitHub pages

This repository comes with a [pre-defined GitHub pages setup](https://github.com/melissawm/disc-unconference-project/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yml).

You can then access this site at `https://numfocus.github.io/disc-unconference-2023-projects/`.

### Translations

Translatable sources can be generated as `.pot` files with:

```bash
sphinx-build unconference unconference/_build/gettext -b gettext
```

`.po` files can then be generated with sphinx-intl:

```bash
sphinx-intl update -p unconference/_build/gettext -l es
```

`.po` files should be committed to the repo. `.pot` files should not, they should be generated when
needed with `gettext` as shown above. `-l` flag is what indicates what languages should be
created/updated.

The content can then be translated: locally with poedit or via transifex/crowdin?

## Objectives

* To provide open-source projects with:
  * a list of standards or guidelines on collecting data and performing two areas of analysis (contributor and community), and
  * recommendations for how projects can use those data insights to retain contributors of different levels.

So that projects can identify diversity gaps in their contributor communities, understand contributor seniority, and understand community satisfaction levels. The end goal is to improve governance and support their contributors.

## Methodology

Two areas of potential analysis.

* **Contributors**: We want to software projects to be able to map the relationships between contributors to the open-source project.
  * This would be useful in order to understand the entirety of a contributorâ€™s level of experience across any/all projects (no prior experience, new to project but experienced elsewhere, regular contributor to the project)
  * Frequency of contribution: evaluate the correlation between contribution and seniority level.
* **Evaluating community at three levels**:
  1. Software contributors
  2. Software users
  3. Board of Directors or leadership (if any) and get perspectives for how to improve the community. Essentially a satisfaction survey.

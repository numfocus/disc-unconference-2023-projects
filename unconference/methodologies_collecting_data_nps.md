# Survey: Satisfaction Data

## Introduction

Open Source (OS) projects do not often have a standard mechanism for collecting
feedback from their communities. Gathering data is the best method to test
assumptions and objectively measure how satisfied the community is. Satisfaction
can be measured from two perspectives; the people who contribute and those who
use the tool.

In September 2023 a group of OS contributors gathered in person at the DISC
Unconference event. This guide represents a continuation of that work done by a
subset of those gathered who were keen on metrics and data. We invite you to
gather a new perspective and collect data with the goal of measuring
satisfaction trends as a measure of the health of your project.

**What is Net Promoter Score (NPS)? What is the goal of measuring NPS?**
[needs additional context]

**What can be done with results?**

- Identify the reasons why your contributors and users are detractors of your
  open source project.
- Set goals that will increase the number of promoters of your project.
- Compare year over the year NPS, create dashboard (pending - can we create a
  dashboard)

**Data privacy** The privacy of respondents is important and should be
protected. Do not ask questions that may lead to respondents being identified.
This is especially important where the community or sample size is small.

## Community: Targeted Respondents

### Contributors

People who contribute to an OS project. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT LIMITED TO CODE.
Contributors can also be users but for the purposes of this survey we are asking
them to evaluate their experience as Contributors.

- Code contributor - a person who opens a pull request
- Organizers/speakers for events, meetings, conferences
- Writing, editing and updating documentation
- UI or UX Design
- Testing
- Operations activities that move forward the goals of a project, such as but
  not limited to: project management, social media administration,
  communications administration, fundraising, governance

### Users

People who use software but do not contribute to it. Has used the software to
perform a task in the past 12 months.

## Documentation: How to conduct an NPS Survey

### Survey Checklist

- Familiarize yourself with NPS, read documentation
- Socialize the idea of using NPS among your project’s leadership to secure
  support or consensus for your idea including a project plan for open and close
  dates for the survey and a process for analyzing data
- Create a survey in any software you prefer - see the questions below
- Define collection methods and where you will promote the survey
- Invite your community to answer
- Once you have data in hand you will need to spend some time analyzing and
  summarizing results
- Share results with your community

### What is Net Promoter Score?

The NPS assumes a subdivision of respondents into "promoters" who provide
ratings of 9 or 10, "passives" who provide ratings of 7 or 8, and "detractors"
who provide ratings of 6 or lower. The net promoter score results from a
calculation that involves subtracting the percentage of detractors from the
percentage of promoters collected by the survey item. The result of the
calculation is typically expressed as an integer rather than a percentage.

### Contributor Survey Questions

1. Are your contributions to Project X code, non code, both?

    > Hypothesis - NPS for those who contribute both is higher and we can use
    > that as a way to demonstrate the value of encouraging engineers to make
    > non code contributions.

2. On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely is it that you would recommend contributing
   to project x to a friend or colleague?

3. Please tell us more about why you provided this rating.

### User Survey Questions

1. On a scale of 0 to 10, On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely is it that you would
   recommend using project x to a friend or colleague?

2. Please tell us more about why you provided this rating.

### How to analyze results of your survey

- Calculate NPS (pending)
- Manually evaluate open ended comments
- Compare segments (for Contributors survey only)

## Challenges

**Collecting a representative sample.** The size of an OS community can be hard
to quantify therefore the percentage of response will be hard to quantify. How
can we define what the target number of respondents is?

**Survey should be conducted once a year.** There is no benchmark for NPS in
Open Source (that we’re aware of) Therefore the value that we propose is in
comparing year over year satisfaction data. This means the survey will need to
be conducted more than once in order to be valuable.

## Project Leaders + Invitation to participate

- Anavelyz Perez (Open Science Lab) and Ana Ruvalcaba (Project Jupyter) lead on
  this work and plan to continue collaborating and sharing their experiences
  with any pilot programs which may be hosted. Perez and Ruvalcaba will work
  together to continue refining the documentation.
- If you have conducted an NPS survey in any context or you would like to join
  us please open an issue.

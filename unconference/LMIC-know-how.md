# Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn't ask

## Project description
**Description**: Collaboratively creating a curriculum and coaching program to ensure that "hidden curriculum" is less hidden, so that funders and potential grantees from different income levels can engage fairly.

**Proposed outcome**: Project proposal to share with global north philanthropy looking to make a difference in the global south

**Value added**: Levelling the playing field with regards to access to resources

## Learner personas

### María (she/her)
Maria is in her early 30s. She was born and raised in Bolivia but works and lives in Argentina. She obtained an undergraduate degree in psychology in Bolivia and PhD in psychology in Argentina. She currently works as a postdoctoral researcher. Maria's goals are to obtain research grants to perform research, although she can’t pay herself from a grant. In her line of work international grants are preferred, since local funds are more restrictive. Her professional interests are neuroscience, cognitive development and working memory, as well as open science (data sharing and aggregation/interoperability). Maria has received local grants before, but none from other countries. Personal challenges that Maria is facing include a high cost of living in her home city, which is even harder because she sends money home to her family. Her professional challenges: she doesn’t know how to get started applying to international grants, and is not supported by her host institution in applying internationally.

### Aleksey (they/them)

Aleksey is in his early 50s, born and raised in Ukraine, where they also currently live and work. They are a geneticist by training, working with fruit flies. Aleksey is a mid-career, employed as an Associate Research Scientist (a permanent, tenured role) in Kiev/Kyiv. Their goal is to expand into new experimental methods within a long-running research program and receive grants to engage in research (they cannot receive salary from grants). Funding would pay for a PhD research assistant or postdoc as well as pay for resources to undertake research activities. Their professional interests include molecular genetics, cell biology, rare diseases, with computational modeling (but not with open source software). Aleksey has received local grants before but failed at obtaining funding from an international funder, as their proposal was miscalibrated to the solicitation). Aleksey is a person with disability, requiring voice assistive technology, and is also a parent of two teenagers. The challenges related to obtaining an international grant include language (Aleksey's native tongue, Ukranian, has a Cyrillic alphabet), which presents a barrier to submitting in English and collaborating internationally. Challenges to successfully applying for grant funding include: 1) current geopolitical instability in Aleksey’s home means grants are perceived as risky, and 2) Aleksey is still learning how to engage fully in open science practices.


### Mohamed (he/him)

Mohamed (he/him) is in his mid twenties. He is from Mali where he lives with his parents and several siblings. He has sporadic ad-hoc income and is a freelancer. He is a native French speaker with basic English knowledge. He has completed some undergraduate courses at the university and has engineering background. He leads a citizen-driven grassroots organization that performs investigative journalism, reporting on governmental policies around ecological issues like environmental sustainability and climate change, and social issues like femicides. Mohamed’s goals are to find a way to have the grassroots organisation become sustainable, including paying wages to staff and supporting infrastructure like cloud computing and computers. He would also like to receive travel grants to support additional investigative journalism. Mohamed has never received any grant before (neither local or international). Mohamed doesn’t know where to find grants and lacks familiarity with the administrative process involved; moreover, he has no experience in designing large-scale research projects. Some of the questions Mohamed has are: What are the requirements of a donor? How do I report to them? How can I use the money? How do I pay people?
